Stretch Goals:
- Add Scoreboard
- Make it look better.
- Add to the fish lists to make them more robust and interesting.
- Add a chance to fish from different arrays per square depending on total points, rather than creating a separate array for middling points.
- Adjust the gamebox grid so that it is always a square shape.
- Add the chances to get a 'lucky' cast or a 'super' catch, which will return a cast and give double fish respectively.
